# ToDo List Application
This is a command-line ToDo List application implemented in both TypeScript and JavaScript. The program is designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently.<br>

# 1. Key Features
## 1. Command-line Interface:
- The application runs directly in the terminal, providing a simple and quick way to manage tasks.<br>

## 2. Cross-platform Compatibility:
The shebang #!/usr/bin/env node ensures the script can be executed on various Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS.<br>

## 3. Task Storage:
Tasks are stored in an array called toDoArray, allowing for easy manipulation and management of todo items.<br>

## 4. Flexible Development:
The project includes both TypeScript (.ts) and JavaScript (.js) files, enabling developers to work in their preferred language.<br>

## 5. Dynamic Typing:
The TypeScript version uses any type for the toDoArray, providing flexibility in the types of data that can be stored.<br>

# Technical Details
* Language: TypeScript/JavaScript<br>
* Runtime Environment: Node.js<br>
* Data Structure: Array (toDoArray)<br>
* Execution: Can be run directly as a script or through Node.js<br>
## Usage
To use the application:<br><br>

1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.<br>
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.<br>
3 .Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.<br>
4. Run the application using one of the following commands:<br>
* For TypeScript: ./main.ts (make sure to compile it first if necessary)<br>
-  For JavaScript: node main.js<br>
# Development
Developers can choose to work with either the TypeScript or JavaScript version of the application. The TypeScript version offers additional type safety and modern language features, while the JavaScript version provides straightforward execution without compilation.<br><br>

This ToDo List application serves as a foundation for task management and can be extended with additional features such as task prioritization, due dates, or persistent storage in future iterations.<br>
